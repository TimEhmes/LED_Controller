The supplied code runs on an Atmel ATTiny 85 microcontroller, which is used to control an LED strip.
The code processes infrared signals from a remote control to perform functions such as fading the LEDs along spectral colors based on the received commands. The circuit was build and soldered with parts I salvaged from old electronic devices (except for the microcontroller).

For questions feel free to contact me.
