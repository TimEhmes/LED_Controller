The supplied code runs on an Atmel ATTiny 85 microcontroller, which is used to control an LED strip.
The code processes the infrared signals received from a remote control and performs functions such as fading the LED's along spectral colors according to the commands. 
The circuit was build and soldered with parts I salvaged from old electronic devices (except for the microcontroller).

For questions feel free to contact me.
